# Solution to number 3
# Write a program that prints all numbers 1000 and 10,000,
# That are divisible by 6 but not 12. 

# Here I set the range for the sum divisible by using the range function.
# And the formula, if the range is divisible by 6 but not 12.
for i in range (1000, 10000):
# And the formula, if the range is divisible by 6 but not 12.
    i
# Prints out all the results
    print(i)
# Prints out the answers. 
print("All the numbers divisible by 6 but not by 12 in the range 1000, 10000")
print("Have a nice day!")
